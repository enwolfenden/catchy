			<h1>about</h1>
			<p>Our goal is to provide a simple way for people to find cats for adoption across the UK and have them taken in by those who will give them good homes in which they will be loved and cared for. </p>

<p>If you want to	 put a cat up for adoption there’s a simple form (link here) to input your contact. A list of the cat’s information alongside a short biography detailing their temperament and personality with at least one photograph is required. For reasons of safety all cats must be vaccinated and their vaccination certificates uploaded as proof.</p> 	

<p>If you’re looking for a cat enter your location and the distance you’re willing to travel to pick up your new companion. You can include a range of options about you’re the cat you’re looking for including breed and age.</p> 


<p>We are committed to an ethical approach to cat adoption and pet adoption, at the following links is extensive information on looking after cats. This is particularly useful for first time owners! Catchy encourages men and women</p>
